# California Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts the cost of homes in California using **NumPy** and **Pandas** in a Jupyter Notebook. It is based on concepts from the [LinkedIn Learning: Artificial Intelligence Foundations â€“ Machine Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/artificial-intelligence-foundations-machine-learning) course.

## Overview
The project explores California housing data and applies a simple regression model to estimate housing costs. It covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature preparation, and linear regression.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Features
- Load and clean housing dataset  
- Explore key features such as income, location, and population  
- Prepare data using Pandas  
- Apply linear regression to predict housing prices  
- Visualize dataset patterns and model outputs  

## Learning Outcomes
- Use NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation  
- Understand the workflow for building regression models  
- Gain experience working with real housing data
